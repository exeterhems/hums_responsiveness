<mark>TODO: Update CITATION.CFF, created CHANGELOG and archive on Zenodo. THen add releases and DOI badges to README</mark>

This repository contains Stata do-files from the analysis performed for:

> **Comparative responsiveness of preference-based health-related quality of life, social care and wellbeing, condition-specific and generic measures in the context of multiple sclerosis**
> 
> Elizabeth Goodwin, Amy Heather, Nia Morrish, Jenny Freeman, Kate Boddy, Sarah Thomas, Jeremy Chataway, Rod Middleton, Annie Hawton

This is a draft paper currently being submit to journal/s to consider for publication.

## Context

The provided do-files to analyse data from the **UK MS Register**. Analysis was performed in Stata <mark>TODO: add version</mark>, which is a paid software so a Stata license would be required to run these files.

Prior to analysis, the data underwent pre-processing including:

* <mark>TODO: check what steps were in prior do-files, or include them</mark>

After this pre-processing, the dataset format was <mark>TODO: describe the data e.g. patient-level, what sort of columns</mark>

The analysis is described in detail in the publication. However, as a brief recap, the analysis in the do-files in this repository includes:

* `13 Syntax for WS2 longitudinal analysis all phases 20210113.do`
  * Calculate change in utility values for each preference-based measure (PBM) and patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) between each timepoint
  * Identify minimally important differences (MID) in PROMS
  * Identify illness-related events (IRE) from changes in illness-events questionnaire (IEQ)
  * Calculate population descriptives (e.g. age, MS type, utility values)
  * Summarise change in utility values (mean and standard deviation (SD)) in MID PROM group and IRE group 
  * Check for statistical significance in changes using t-tests
* `14 Longitudinal analysis all phases regression.do`
  * Additional processing (e.g. standardised PBMs and PROMs, recoding to set base case)
  * Hausman test and Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM) to determine whether random effects is appropriate
  * Pooled OLS regression on PBMs with continuous or categorical PROMs and with IEQ
  * Check regression assumptions (no outliers, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity of residuals, no multiearity, linear relationships)
* `15 Longitudinal analysis all phases output tables.do`
  * Outputs results into Excel tables (instead of copy+paste of tables from Stata)
* `16 Longitudinal analysis all phases bonferroni and ranking.do`
  * Calculate p-value after Bonferroni correction
  * Rank PBMs by mean change, standardised response mean (SRM), and standardised effect size (SES), and find the median rank
  * Annotate IRE results by whether a low or a high score indicates a positive or negative change
* `17 IEQ Descriptives.do`
  * Describe responses to IEQ (e.g. number and percentage providing each answer)
  * Describe demographics of IEQ samples
