This repository contains Stata do-files from the analysis performed for:

> **Comparative responsiveness of preference-based health-related quality of life, social care and wellbeing, condition-specific and generic measures in the context of multiple sclerosis**
> 
> Elizabeth Goodwin, Amy Heather, Nia Morrish, Jenny Freeman, Kate Boddy, Sarah Thomas, Jeremy Chataway, Rod Middleton, Annie Hawton

This is a draft paper currently being submit to journal/s to consider for publication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-processing

The provided do-files analyse data from the **UK MS Register**. Analysis was performed in **Stata version 17** which is a paid software, so a Stata license would be required to run these files.

Prior to analysis, the data underwent pre-processing in do-files 1 to 12 (not provided). These contain basic syntax:

* To ensure that responses were correctly coded.
* To calculate total scale/subscale scores for PROMs and utility values for PBMs
* To merge data from the 10 extracts provided by the UKMSR (a separate extract was provided for each measure and for demographics) into a single dataset
* To ensure that the dataset for analysis included all register members who provided data at two consecutive time-points (Time-points 1 and 2, and/or Time-points 2 and 3)
* To generate descriptive statistics for included participants.

<br>

## üìú Data description

Whilst the data used in this analysis cannot be provided in this repository, we do offer a description of it below.

After the pre-processing above, we have two `.dta` files, which we use in the analysis below (with do-file 13 starting by merging these files).

**Filename:** *‚ÄúHUMS Workstream 2 Phase 3\WS2_data_ALL_PHASE_3_DATA.dta‚Äù*

Person level data; one row per person.

Columns:

* Item-level responses and total scale/subscale scores for each PROM at Time-point 3.
* Item-level responses and utility values for each PBM at Time-point 3.
* Item-level responses to each IEQ question at Time-point 3.

**Filename:** *‚ÄúHUMS Workstream 2 Phase 2\PHASE 1 AND 2 DATA.dta‚Äù*

Person level data; one row per person.

Columns:

* Item-level responses and total scale/subscale scores for each PROM at Time-point 1.
* Item-level responses and utility values for each PBM at Time-point 1.
* Item-level responses to each IEQ question at Time-point 1.
* Item-level responses and total scale/subscale scores for each PROM at Time-point 2.
* Item-level responses and utility values for each PBM at Time-point 2.
* Item-level responses to each IEQ question at Time-point 2.

## üîç Analysis

The analysis is described in detail in the publication. However, as a brief recap, the analysis in the do-files in this repository includes:

* `13 Syntax for WS2 longitudinal analysis all phases 20210113.do`
  * Calculate change in utility values for each preference-based measure (PBM) and patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) between each timepoint
  * Identify minimally important differences (MID) in PROMS
  * Identify illness-related events (IRE) from changes in illness-events questionnaire (IEQ)
  * Calculate population descriptives (e.g. age, MS type, utility values)
  * Summarise change in utility values (mean and standard deviation (SD)) in MID PROM group and IRE group 
  * Check for statistical significance in changes using t-tests
* `14 Longitudinal analysis all phases regression.do`
  * Additional processing (e.g. standardised PBMs and PROMs, recoding to set base case)
  * Hausman test and Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM) to determine whether random effects is appropriate
  * Pooled OLS regression on PBMs with continuous or categorical PROMs and with IEQ
  * Check regression assumptions (no outliers, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity of residuals, no multiearity, linear relationships)
* `15 Longitudinal analysis all phases output tables.do`
  * Outputs results into Excel tables (instead of copy+paste of tables from Stata)
* `16 Longitudinal analysis all phases bonferroni and ranking.do`
  * Calculate p-value after Bonferroni correction
  * Rank PBMs by mean change, standardised response mean (SRM), and standardised effect size (SES), and find the median rank
  * Annotate IRE results by whether a low or a high score indicates a positive or negative change
* `17 IEQ Descriptives.do`
  * Describe responses to IEQ (e.g. number and percentage providing each answer)
  * Describe demographics of IEQ samples
